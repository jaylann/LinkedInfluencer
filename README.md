## üöÄ Getting Started

### üì¶ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python 3.11+**: Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
- **AWS Account**: To deploy AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3 services.
- **OpenAI API Key**: To utilize OpenAI's GPT for content creation.
- **Zapier Account**: For automatically posting content to LinkedIn.
- **LinkedIn Account**: Well, duh.

### üî® Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linkedinfluencer-automator.git
   cd linkedinfluencer-automator
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file based on the provided template:

   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

   Fill in the required environment variables in `.env`:

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
   AWS_REGION=YOUR_AWS_REGION
   DYNAMODB_SCRAPED_TABLE_NAME=YOUR_DYNAMODB_SCRAPED_TABLE_NAME
   DYNAMODB_POSTS_TABLE_NAME=YOUR_DYNAMODB_POSTS_TABLE_NAME
   S3_BUCKET_NAME=YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME
   RSS_FEED_KEY=YOUR_RSS_FEED_S3_KEY
   RSS_FEED_TITLE=YOUR_RSS_FEED_TITLE
   RSS_FEED_DESCRIPTION=YOUR_RSS_FEED_DESCRIPTION
   RSS_FEED_LINK=YOUR_RSS_FEED_LINK
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## üíª Usage

The application can be run locally or deployed to AWS Lambda. Below are instructions for both scenarios.

### üìå Running Locally

1. **Activate Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Execute the Script**

   ```bash
   python main.py aggregate_news
   python main.py process_items
   ```

   Available actions:

    - `aggregate_news`: Fetches RSS feeds and saves items to DynamoDB.
    - `process_items`: Processes saved DynamoDB items to create LinkedIn posts and trigger posting.
   These can also be set via an environment variable "ACTION". The default value is "aggregate_news".

### üå© Deploying to AWS Lambda

1. **Build Docker Image**

   Ensure you're using the correct platform (`x86` or `arm`):

   ```bash
   docker build -t linkedinfluencer .
   ```

2. **Tag the Docker Image**

   Replace `<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>` and `<REGION>` with your AWS details:

   ```bash
   docker tag linkedinfluencer:latest <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/linkedinfluencer:latest
   ```

3. **Push to Amazon ECR**

   ```bash
   docker push <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/linkedinfluencer:latest
   ```

4. **Set Up AWS Lambda**

    - **Create a Lambda Function** using the pushed Docker image.
    - **Set Environment Variable "ACTION"**: Decide on "aggregate_news" or "process_items" depending on the Lambda function.
    - **Assign Execution Role**: Ensure the Lambda execution role has permissions to access S3, DynamoDB, and other required AWS services.

5. **Schedule with EventBridge**

    - **Data Gathering**: Trigger `aggregate_news` at 00:00 daily.
    - **Post Creation**: Trigger `process_items` during peak LinkedIn engagement times.

## üîó Integration

**Zapier** is integrated to handle the automated posting process:

1. **RSS Feed Setup**: The application updates an XML RSS feed stored in S3.
2. **Zapier Connection**: Configure Zapier to monitor the RSS feed and post new items to LinkedIn.
3. **Automation Workflow**: As new posts are added to the RSS feed, Zapier triggers LinkedIn posts automatically.
